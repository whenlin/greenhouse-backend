This repository is the backend for my 4th year capstone project. This is a Node.js Server that is connected to an arduino board. It receives requests from the client (currently an iphone application) and carries out the corresponding action. It was hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3 which was connected to the Arduino board. They were subsequently fitted to the greenhouse.
